## 1. What is Active Directory?
- **Directory Service** for managing Windows environments.
- Stores and manages information about objects (e.g., users, computers) on the network.
- Used by around **95%** of Fortune 500 companies.

### Key Benefits:
- **Centralized Identity Management**
- **Enhanced Security** (Authentication & Authorization)
- **Scalability** (Supports millions of objects)
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
- **Replication & Redundancy**
- **Delegated Administration**

---

## 2. AD Objects
Common objects in Active Directory include:
- **Users**  
- **Contacts**  
- **Computers**  
- **Groups**  
- **Shared Folders**  
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**  
- **Domains & Domain Controllers**

---

## 3. AD Components
Active Directory consists of various services:
- **AD Domain Services (AD DS)**
- **AD Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)**
- **AD Federation Services (AD FS)**
- **AD Certificate Services (AD CS)**
- **AD Rights Management Services (AD RMS)**

---

## 4. AD Architecture
- **Forests, Trees, and Domains**  
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**  
- **Sites and Subnets**  
- **Domain Controllers**  
- **Global Catalogs**

---

## 5. Replication and Trusts
- **Replication** synchronizes data between Domain Controllers (DCs) across domains.
- **Trusts** allow users in one domain to access resources in another (e.g., one-way, two-way).

---

## 6. Group Policy
- Used to enforce system settings, security policies, and user configurations.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** control configurations for **users** and **computers**.
- **Security Filtering** allows GPOs to be applied selectively.

---

## 7. Authentication Protocols
- **NTLM**: Older challenge-response mechanism.
- **Kerberos**: Default protocol for Active Directory, based on Ticket Granting Tickets (TGT).

---

## 8. Users, Groups, and Computers
- **Users**: Local or domain users.
- **Groups**: Domain Local, Global, Universal, and Security groups.
- **Computers**: Local or domain-joined machines.

---

## 9. Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)
- **ADCS** enables secure digital certificates for authentication, email, and web services.
- Components include **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**, **Certificate Templates**, and **Revocation Lists**.

---

## 10. Best Practices
### General:
- **Backup Strategies**  
- **Patch Management**  
- **Security Policies**  
- **Audit Policies**  

### Security Best Practices:
- **Implement Least Privilege**  
- **Secure Domain Controllers**  
- **Use Strong Password Policies**  
- **Audit AD regularly**

---

## Troubleshooting Tools & Techniques
- **Event Viewer**
- **dcdiag**
- **netdiag**
- **repadmin**

---

## Performance Optimization
- **Optimize DNS Configuration**
- **Group Policy Processing**
- **Replication Management**

---

## High Availability and DR
- **Redundant Domain Controllers**
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**

---

## Additional Security Recommendations
- **Disable insecure protocols** like LLMNR and NetBIOS.
- **SMB and Kerberos Hardening**
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

---

## Conclusion
- Plan your **Active Directory Structure** carefully.
- Implement strong **Group Policies** and **User/Group Management** strategies.
- Prioritize **Security** with best practices and **continuous auditing**.
